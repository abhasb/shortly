Hi Aaron

I’ve been following micro1's work in the LLM space and am very interested in joining the team. 

With over 3.5 years of experience as a Software Engineer and a background from IIT Bhilai, I have a strong foundation in building scalable systems. My recent work at Turing involved automating LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations to benchmark model performance against complex instructions, specifically focusing on cognitive inertia. Additionally, I’ve built MCP servers and unified clients to enable natural language analytics via AI for business teams. 

I am proficient in Python, Java, and C++, with extensive experience in FastAPI, AWS, and Kubernetes.

Attached my full resume for your reference.
